&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gujarat University was conceived in the nineteen twenties in the minds of public-spirited <br>
and learned men like Gandhiji, Sardar Patel, Acharya Anandshankar B. Dhruva, Dada Saheb Mavlankar,<br>
Kasturbhai Lalbhai and many others. However, the University could come into existence only after the <br>
achievement of independence.In 1949, the University was incorporated under the Gujarat University<br>
Act of the State Government ‘as a teaching and affiliating University. This was done as a measure <br>
of decentralisation and reorganization 
of University education in the then Province of Bombay.</font></p></marquee>

post-graduate instruction has been statutorily given to the University, and accordingly <br>
it has evolved a plan of co-ordinated instruction under the direct control and supervision <br>
of the University so as to ensure efficient and diversified instruction.</font></p></marquee>
